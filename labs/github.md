The goal of this lab is to introduce you to Github as a social coding platform, and illustrate the capabilities you will need to explore to do the [project](../project.md). 

# Git and Version Control

There are many Git tutorials. We will not cover Git in this course, but please do a tutorial if you are inexperienced or unfamiliar with distributed VC. Githiub is oriented around Git and Git's distributed model. A project on GitHub fundamentally creates a repository—called 'main'—which your team can clone, do work, and synchronize with each other, including 'main' (but main isn't particularly special in the distributed model).

# Project Selection

- You will first select a **reference** **system**. This may be from selected from those described in a chapter in one of the online books [The Architecture of Open Source Systems Volume I and Volume II](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) (you should select a system from these books at the bottom of the page, not the other two books at the top of the page). Or it may be another system of your choosing. Next, you will select **two additional open source systems** that solve the same underlying problem as your reference system. For example, if you selected an image processing library, you should select two additional image processing libraries. 

  

  Some considerations in selecting systems:

  - You MUST select three systems that solve the same underlying problem, i.e., have the same business goals and user base. Don't be too esoteric or finding 2 other systems will be hard.
  - You are encouraged, but not required, to select a reference system from [The Architecture of Open Source Systems Volume I and Volume II](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html). (Not 500 Lines or Performance).
  - You MUST select systems that have not already been selected by other groups. Systems will be available first come, first served.
  - Choose systems written in a language that all members of your group are comfortable reading.
  - You MUST choose systems that are open source and have their source code hosted on a publicly visible version control system.
  - You MUST choose systems that are non-trivial and have at least 100 source files.
  - You should choose systems that are **well documented**, as this will make your reverse engineering work easier. Look for projects that have wiki pages, tutorials for new project contributors, technical descriptions of how key aspects work, and have active, archived mailing lists or issue trackers. Each of these documentations will offer potentially important insights as you work to understand the architecture and design behind the project's source code.
  - Finally, your project will be something you and your group work on across the whole semester. You should pick something that is interesting and exciting for you.
