Authors: Neil Ernst

# Running Total (this will change each milestone):   

NB: for all milestones, basic clean coding style: comments, standardized indentation, lack of code smells, is expected. Your submission and repository should show the following: 
	- Travis CI is being used (M3+)
	- a static analysis tool and linter has been applied (M3+)
	- Typescript project best practices are followed (M3+)

# Milestone 1     / 10

## Marking Guide	
- ASRs complete and capture
  - need to persist data
  - need to manage user state and cookies
  - security and privacy
  - usability
  - performance and latency
  - async issues

Marks deducted:
- scenarios seem to have little to no connection with the project (-2)
- poor technical writing  (-2)
- Quality of scenarios (clear analysis of stimulus, response, response measure)

# Milestone 2    / 20

## Marking Guide
- technical writing is clear and concise (key decisions are documented; organization is easy to follow; basic English spelling and writing conventions adhered to)
- design follows basic principles like cohesion/coupling, single responsibility, open/closed
- design addresses QAR from M1
- design provides path for implementing user stories in M1
- design models follow conventions for class and sequence diagrams
- design justifies technology choices
- ADRs (3+) explain why decision was taken, what the context is, and what alternatives were rejected
- ADRs don't capture trivial design decisions

# Milestone 3    / 20

## Marking Guide	
- code compiles 
- code conventions/CI from above (commented, code style, design principles)
- working demo 
- clear explanation of what user stories were satisfied in this iteration
- design as implemented follows design doc, or change rationale is present in README
- async is async when necessary
- TSLint does not complain
- test suite present/part of CI
- test coverage reasonable and meaningful
